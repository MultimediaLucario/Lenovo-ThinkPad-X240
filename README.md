- A PC with a copy of Windows 10 or higher installed

- 4GB USB Stick

- [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/)

 - For USB larger than 16 GB to format in FAT32, use the [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) method.

- A copy of the [EFI](https://github.com/MultimediaLucario/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X240/releases/) folder

- [macrecovery.py](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases)

- This will require [Python](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/python-39/9p7qfqmjrfp7?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) installed.
#

1. To grab legacy installers is super easy, first grab a copy of [OpenCorePkg](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases) and head to /Utilities/macrecovery/. Next copy the folder path for the macrecovery folder. 

<img width="974" alt="file-path 0aea4278" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72415505/156628158-190cba5d-6114-4972-aa83-f1b14749e34d.png">


#
2. From here, you'll want to open up a Command Prompt and cd into the macrecovery folder that we copied earlier:

cd Paste_Folder_Path

## Lenovo ThinkPad X240 OpenCore Update Guide

1. Download and install the [OpenCore Updater](https://github.com/mswgen/oc-updater/releases).
2. When the app opens, press Get Started. A dialog will appear asking you to select the EFI directory.
3. Mount the EFI Partition on your drive using [Clover Configurator](https://mackie100projects.altervista.org/download-clover-configurator/).
4. Select your EFI directory. It's usually /Volumes/EFI/EFI. It should have BOOT and OC directories inside.
5. If your OpenCore version is detected, your OpenCore version and list of kexts you are using will be displayed. If your OpenCore version is not detected, you will be asked to select the OpenCore version you are using. Select the version you are using and press Select this version.
6. If you are not using the latest version of OpenCore, the app will ask you to update. Press Update to update OpenCore.
7. The app will start to download OpenCore, kexts, and Binary Data. this might take some time and you might see the spinning beach ball. DO NOT CLOSE THE APP.
8. When the app finishes downloading, it will create a backup of your old EFI and will swap files with the new ones.
9. Then, it will update config.plist. When it's done, it will display that it's done. It will also display the list of not updated kexts, the backup directory, and that OpenCore Vault is disabled(if it was enabled). You need to reboot your computer to see the changes.


### Bios
These are the recommended settings to have everything working properly:

**Security Tab**:
- `Security Chip > Security Chip [Disabled]`
- `Anti-Theft > Intel (R) AT Module Activation > Current Setting [Disabled]`
- `Anti-Theft > Computrace > Computrace Module Activation > Current Setting [Disabled]`

**Note**: These laptops do have whitelist which doesn't allow you to use other Card than the Intel AC7260.
In order to use a different / supported card, you need to mod your bios (remove whitelist).


### Secure Boot
Users with `1366x768` or `1600x900` displays can go ahead and enable secure boot and enjoy it.
Users with upgraded displays to `1080p` or native `1080p` displays will have garbled screen if CSM is disabled in BIOS (which can't be left enabled if Secure Boot enabled)
In order to fix this problem we need to patch `Display-EDID`.

### Patching Display EDID [WIP]

First we need to download these three Applications: [Hackintool](https://github.com/headkaze/Hackintool/releases), [AWEDIDEditor](https://www.analogway.com/files/uploads/produit/download/en/aw_edideditor_setup_2_00_13_macos.zip) and [HexFiend](https://github.com/HexFiend/HexFiend/releases)

- Open Hackintool and go to the `Displays` tab and click the Export icon/button on the bottom-right side.
- On desktop, you will see some new files appeared, now open the `EDID-***-****-orig.bin` file with AWEDIDEditor
- Go to `Detailed Data` tab and change `H. Sync Width:` value to `100`.
- Save the EDID as `Patched-EDID` or whatever name you like just to know which one is the patched one
- Open the `Patched-EDID` with HexFiend and make sure you expand it so it contains 8 columns of code bytes.
- Copy the 128 bytes code and paste it into: `EFI>OC>Config.plist>DeviceProperties>PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)>AAPL00,override-no-connect`
- Save the config.plist file and reboot, Enjoy Secure Boot without garbled screen.


### Non TouchScreen Displays
If your Lenovo Thinkpad X240 doesn't have a TouchScreen display, it is required for you to disable the kext responsible for TouchScreen.
Go to `EFI/OC/Config.plist > Kernel > Add >` and disable the 4 following kexts:
- `VoodooI2CServices.kext - Enabled = No`
- `VoodooGPIO.kext - Enabled = No`
- `VoodooI2C.kext - Enabled = No`
- `VoodooI2CHID.kext - Enabled = No`

### TouchPad
Most of the users have probably already upgraded to a X250 Touchpad (the one with Physical Buttons) and this one does work natively, no need to touch anything.
For you users that have the standard Touchpad that came with this laptop, you have to do some changes as VoodooRMI doesn't seem to work very well with them.

Go to `EFI/OC/Config.plist > Kernel > Add` and disable the VoodooRMI kexts:
- `VoodooRMI.kext - Enabled = No`
- `VoodooRMI.kext/Contents/PlugIns/RMISMBus.kext - Enabled = No`
- `VoodooRMI.kext/Contents/PlugIns/VoodooTrackpoint.kext - Enabled = No`
- `VoodooRMI.kext/Contents/PlugIns/VoodooInput.kext - Enabled = No`

Once done, enable the VoodooPS2Controller kexts for Touchpad:

- `VoodooPS2Controller.kext/Contents/PlugIns/VoodooInput.kext - Enabled = Yes`
- `VoodooPS2Controller.kext/Contents/PlugIns/VoodooPS2Trackpad.kext - Enabled = Yes`
- `VoodooPS2Controller.kext/Contents/PlugIns/VoodooPS2Mouse.kext - Enabled = Yes`

Now enable the `SSDT-TPD.aml` for Touchpad to work with VoodooPS2:  
- `EFI/OC/Config.plist > ACPI > Add > SSDT-TPD.aml > Enabled = Yes`

### YogaSMC
To have working Keyboard Function Keys (Fn) and Fan reading etc, you need to install the YogaSMCPane and the YogaSMC App.
YogaSMC.kext is already included in the EFI so when yo go to releases tab, you download the **YogaSMC-App-release.dmg**
- https://github.com/zhen-zen/YogaSMC


### Audio
ALCPlugFIx is required to fix static noise on headphones, however Black-Dragon74 released a Swift version that doesn't require `hda-verb`, `alc-verb` or `CodecCommander` kext. the `ALCPlugFix.zip` is included in the Tools folder.

**Installation**:
- Extract ALCPlugFix zip into desktop
- Open terminal and type following commands one by one on the listed order:
- `sudo spctl --master-disable`
- `sudo mkdir /usr/local/bin/`
- `cd desktop/ALCPlugFix`
- `sudo cp -R ALC3232.plist /usr/local/bin/`
- `./install.sh`
- Now the installer will ask you to drop the `ALC3232.plist` into the terminal window.
- Open a new finder window and press `Shift + Cmd(Alt) + G` to open a new `go to folder:` window
- Now type: `/usr/local/bin/`
- Drag the `ALC3232.plist` from the `/usr/local/bin` folder into the terminal window and press enter.
- Done


### Wireless and Bluetooth

#### Intel AC7260
Users with Intel AC7260 cards can enjoy out of the box support for both Wireless and Bluetooth.
Keep in mind that Airportitlwm/itlwm is still in early development and only `N` speeds are supported.

#### DW1560 & DW1830
Users with one of these two cards first need to disable the intel kexts:

- `EFI/OC/Config.plist > Kernel > Add > Airportitlwm > Enabled = No`
- `EFI/OC/Config.plist > Kernel > Add > IntelBluetoothInjector > Enabled = No`
- `EFI/OC/Config.plist > Kernel > Add > IntelBluetoothFirmware > Enabled = No`

Then enable the corresponding kexts for those two cards:

- `EFI/OC/Config.plist > Kernel > Add > AirportBrcmFixup > Enabled = Yes`
- `EFI/OC/Config.plist > Kernel > Add > AirPortBrcm4360_Injector > Enabled = Yes`
- `EFI/OC/Config.plist > Kernel > Add > BrcmBluetoothInjector > Enabled = Yes`
- `EFI/OC/Config.plist > Kernel > Add > BrcmFirmwareData > Enabled = Yes`
- `EFI/OC/Config.plist > Kernel > Add > BrcmPatchRAM3 > Enabled = Yes`

#### DW1820A
This card uses the same kexts as DW1560, DW1830 but needs this additional injector:
- `EFI/OC/Config.plist > Kernel > Add > AirPortBrcmNIC_Injector > Enabled = Yes`

We also need to disable `pci-aspm-default` to fix system freezes caused from this card:
Go into `EFI/OC/Config.plist > DeviceProperties >` and rename / uncomment:
- `#PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1C,0x1)/Pci(0x0,0x0)` to `PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1C,0x1)/Pci(0x0,0x0)` and the device property:
- `#pci-aspm-default` to `pci-aspm-default`

#### BCM4360NG
This card is the best one you can find for the moment, it is the same as the Apple BCM94360CS2 which works natively but it does have a standard NGFF form factor.

#### BCM94360CS2
This is the native Apple Wireless and Bluetooth card that can be found on MacBookPro(s).
In order to fit this one you will have to buy the NGFF adapter and the extending cable module.
There is not enough room to fit the full height so you will be required to place it somewhere else.

#### Country Code for Wireless Cards
Some countries have different 5GHz bands and may not be supported for some, the default one is set as US.
You can specify other country codes like: **US**, **CN**, **#a**, etc by going into:
- `EFI/OC/Config.plist > DeviceProperties > Add > PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1C,0x1)/Pci(0x0,0x0)` and rename/uncomment:
- `#country-code` to `country-code` and set the desired value (**#a** is the preset value, replace with the country code that you need)
